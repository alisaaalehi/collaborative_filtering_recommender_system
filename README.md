# Collaborative Filtering Based Recommender system
Collaborative filtering algorithm to predict user ratings for products, based on previous ratings.

### What is the goal?
Here I am sharing a python implementation of a collaborative filtering algorithm used to solve the   [**Netflix problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize).
We have a bunch of users that we do not know anything about them except the ratings that they gave to some of the films in our list. We want to use just this information to predict their possible ratings to other movies in the list that they haven't rated so far.

### What is in this repository?
Most importantly, the jupyter notebook file `collaborative_filtering_recommender.jpynb` that guides you through the algorithm step by step. The dataset which is a small part of the original dataset also provided here.

As I mentioned, it is meant to be like a **tutorial** implementation and not an efficient implementation, but I've tried to make it efficient as long as it does not hurt the purpose of the project.

### Can I used this code for other products rather than films?
Yes, as long as you frame your data similar to the dataset used in this project. Look at the code or the description file in the `netflix` folder to know more about the data.

### How to run it?
Just open the file by jupyter notebook and run all the cells.
